# Simple-JDBC-app
This application has a simple LoginFrame with two fields(username and password) and two buttons:
- Login, that searches for the provided username and password in a users database and connects to a main application window if username and password match
- Sign up, that allows the user to set up a username and a password and stors them in the users database.
And also has a MainFrame which is connected to a products database shows a list of products in the interface and lets users add or remove products from the database.

I used IntelliJ IDEA for Java code, XAMPP for creating a local server, MySQL Workbench for database management.
